# Jack's Car Rental - A Reinforcement Learning Example Using Python
## Introduction
This small Python package solves the Jack's Car Rental problem defined 
in the classic reinforcement book 
**_Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction_** by Sutton and Barto &copy; 2012
(Example 4.2, Chapter 4)

## Run the run
Language: python3
Required libraries: numpy, scipy for numerical and statistical computing; 
matplotlib for plotting.

I suggest you use virtual environment to run the code:
```bash
pyvenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code structure
All core computational codes are under jackscarrental/ directory 
as a python library.

Test, example and demo codes are under tests/ directory.
